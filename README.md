## 🎯 Use Case: Scenario Overview

**John**, a patient, logs into the platform and searches for a general physician available in his location. He filters doctors by availability and specialty, books a slot, uploads medical reports, and gets notified once the appointment is confirmed. After the consultation, the doctor shares a summary and follow-up advice through the platform.
